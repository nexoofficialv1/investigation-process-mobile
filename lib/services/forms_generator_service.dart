Sir,
        In forwarding herewith the arrested accused person namely- ____________________________ S/O- ____________________________ of ____________________________, P.S.- ____________________, Dist.- ____________________ before your honour's court with all connected paper and proper Police escort I beg to report that on __________ at ______ hrs received a written complaint from one ${caseFile.complainantName.isEmpty ? '____________________' : caseFile.complainantName} to the effect that ${caseFile.firGist.isEmpty ? '____________________________________________________________________________' : caseFile.firGist}. Over this complaint the above referred case has been started and as per endorsement I took up its investigation.

        During investigation I visited the PO, prepared rough sketch map of the PO with its index in separate sheets of paper. Examined the complainant and other available witnesses and recorded their statements u/s-180 BNSS in separate sheets of paper. Thereafter the FIR named accused person was arrested after observing all legal formalities. The grounds of arrest have been informed to the accused person and his/her family member in their vernacular language and a copy of the same was served upon them.

        Under the above fact and circumstances, I therefore pray before your Honour's court that arrested accused person namely- ____________________________ may kindly be taken in judicial custody / police custody as prayed for till investigation is over. I strongly oppose bail on the following grounds:-

(1) The case is in green stage of investigation. If released on bail at this stage, the accused may hamper the investigation.
(2) Many important witnesses are yet to be examined. If released on bail at this stage, the accused may induce witnesses.
(3) Police custody / further interrogation may be required for the purpose of investigation.''';
